# Aclaraciones Bancarias Platform

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive banking clarification platform designed to streamline banking clarifications, enhance user experience, and provide administrators with powerful tools for managing sessions and users. It features a dual-domain architecture for client and admin interfaces, built with Express.js and React. The platform offers real-time communication, robust banking session management, user authentication, SMS integration, file management, and Telegram notifications. Key capabilities include automated payment verification via Bitso API and OpenAI GPT-4o Vision, and a sophisticated link management system with Bitly integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The platform uses a multi-domain setup (`aclaracion.info` for clients and `panel.aclaracion.info` for administration) served by a single Express.js backend. The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui. The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript, PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM, and WebSockets for real-time updates. Authentication is session-based with Passport.js, supporting role-based access, device limitations, and account expiration.

**Key Architectural Decisions and Features:**

*   **Database Schema**: Manages users, executives, banking sessions (including screen types, user inputs, file attachments), SMS configurations, and notification preferences.
*   **Authentication**: Session-based with Passport.js, incorporating anti-bot measures, behavioral analysis, and OTP verification for executives. Supports various account types (Individual, Office) with differing device limits and management capabilities.
*   **Screen Management**: Dynamic screen types guide users through banking workflows (validation, OTP, card info, transfers, protection banking).
*   **File Management**: Multer-based uploads for protection banking with Telegram notifications for downloads.
*   **Data Flow**: Admin-initiated sessions with QR codes, real-time client-admin updates via WebSockets, and a guided banking workflow.
*   **Security**: Anti-detection, rate limiting, header obfuscation, and comprehensive input validation.
*   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for a consistent and modern design.
*   **WhatsApp Bot Architecture**: Utilizes `@whiskeysockets/baileys` for multi-user WhatsApp Web connections, offering independent bot instances, QR code management, hierarchical menus, and dynamic content placeholders. Conversation history is stored in the database.
*   **Payment Verification Flow**: Integrates Bitso API and OpenAI GPT-4o Vision for automated payment verification, with a fallback to manual review and a discount code system.
*   **Payment Bot (Telegram)**: A dedicated Telegram bot for payment receipt notifications and manual user activation by administrators.
*   **Link Management System**: Provides comprehensive link creation and management with single-use tokens (1-hour expiration), Bitly URL shortening, bank-specific URL paths, user quota management (150 links/week resetting on Mondays), active session monitoring, and admin controls for viewing/resetting user quotas. Links remain active indefinitely until manually cancelled, and Bitly links are automatically deleted upon cancellation. Bitly link titles include bank branding for better recognition.
*   **Bank-Specific Screen Flow Configuration System**: Allows both administrators and regular users to define custom sequences of screens for each bank. These configurations are stored in the database (`bank_screen_flows` for global admin flows, `user_bank_flows` for individual user flows) and are applied to sessions when links are created. The UI supports drag-and-drop step management with configurable screen types, durations, and user input requirements.
*   **Personalized Telegram Notifications**: Each user receives Telegram notifications only for their own sessions via `telegramChatId` lookup. The system sends notifications to both the main admin (if configured) and the session creator (if they have a Telegram chat ID linked). Error handling is independent for each recipient to ensure delivery resilience.
*   **Telegram Bot Link Generation**: The `/generar` command allows users to create banking links directly from Telegram with an interactive bank selection menu. The system enforces comprehensive security controls including role verification (user/admin only), rate limiting (3 links/hour per user), session timeout (5 minutes of inactivity), anti-concurrency checks, and account expiration validation. All link generation attempts are audited with warnings logged when limits are exceeded. Generated links appear in the user's panel and follow the same quota and flow configuration as panel-generated links.
